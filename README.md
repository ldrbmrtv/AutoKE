<h1>AutoKE: Automated Knowledge Extraction</h1>

Today machine learning is one of the most relevant information technologies. Among modern methods, supervised learning shows the highest practical applicability. However, it has significant limitations, including</p>
<ul>
  <li>need for large samples of labeled data</li>
  <li>need for an expert designing learning pipelines</li>
  <li>insufficient inerpretability of learning results</li>
</ul>
This prevents the widespreading of intellectual technologies and the advent of Industry 4.0.
<hr>
  
<p>AutoKE project is aimed at overcoming these limitations based on technologies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>unsupervised learning</li>
  <li>automated machine learning</li>
  <li>ontology learning</li>
</ul>
Our mission is the creation of intelligent technologies of a new generation, capable of solving more complex problems than the capabilities of modern AI allow.
<hr>

<p>Our tasks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>development of software products and systems that democratize intelligent technologies</li>
  <li>obtaining fundamental theoretical results in the field of Computer Science and Artificail Intelligence</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<p>Examples of our research:</p>
<ul>
  <li>regularizing clustering models with adjusted entropy</li>
  <li>accelerating hyper-parameter optimization in clustering based on prior information criteria</li>
  <li>automated clustering model selection for ontology learning</li>
</ul>
